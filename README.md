## **Idea**
Create a website which it will be similar to reddit website (link: https://www.reddit.com).
It will have communities for users who have interest in **music**, **films**, **game** and **web development** (contain existing projects) and
will offer the capability of both extending existing as well as creating new communities according to users’ interests.

See website here: 

## **Set up the development environment**
Make sure you have the following tools available.

**Backend**:
1. IntelliJ (with Java 17) using:
      * Spring Web
      * Spring Data JPA
      * PostgreSQL
      * Lombok
2. PostgreSQL (with PgAdmin)
3. Docker

**Frontend:**
1. NPM/Node.js (LTS – Long Term Support version)
2. React CRA (create-react-app)
3. Visual Studio Code Text Editor/ IntelliJ
4. Browser Developer Tools for testing and debugging

## **Requirements for the Lagalt.no-Project**

**Primary Goal**

Understanding social network users’ needs, especially reddit, and find them efficient solutions.

**Complexity Level**

Basic development, creating a **database**, an **API** and a **website** that makes requests on it.

**Roles**

1. **Non-login user** can navigate through pages without joining projects’ chats and seeing fewer information about them.
2. **Login user** has the same rights as a **non-login user** and much more like making requests to join projects, so they 
can be added to them or even create their own projects. A login user can be:
         * **Project member** and they have access to other projects’ information like files repository and chat.
         * **Project owner** and they can add users after a request, remove users, change projects’ information and even delete projects (change project’s stage to completed).

**Website’s View**
