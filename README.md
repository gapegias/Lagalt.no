## **Idea**
Create a website which will be similar to reddit website (link: https://www.reddit.com),
will have communities for users who have interest in **music**, **films**, **game** and **web development** (contain existing projects) and
will offer the capability of both extending existing as well as creating new communities according to usersâ€™ interests.

See website here:
